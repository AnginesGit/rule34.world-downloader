# rule34.world-playlist-downloader
rule34.world playlist downloader.

example:
'''
$ ./r34world
paste playlist url:
https://rule34.world/view/<ID>
'''

## Help
- this script only can get the first page of playlist (60 posts), urls getting x pages doesn't work for playlist, only searching tags, if anyone can help with that, will be appreciated.
